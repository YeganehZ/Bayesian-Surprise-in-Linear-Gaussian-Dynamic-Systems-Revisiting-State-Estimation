# Bayesian Surprise in Linear Gaussian Dynamic Systems: Revisiting State Estimation

This repository contains my MATLAB codes for those interested in implementing my results published in "Bayesian Surprise in Linear Gaussian Dynamic Systems: Revisiting State Estimation". I have included a PDF of my conference paper, followed by two folders named Experiment 1, 2, and 3. Experiment 1 includes all the codes to run the RMSRE of the three proposed Kalman filters over 2000 runs of Monte Carlo simulations that are depicted in Fig. 1 of the paper. Meanwhile, Experiment 2  includes all the codes to run Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 discussed in the paper. Also, Experiment 3 includes all the codes to investigate filter consistency in terms of Bayesian surprise that results in Fig. 4 in the paper.
In all three files, please run the main file to plot the system performance. Before running the codes please review the simulation setup detailed thoroughly in Section 5 of the paper.
